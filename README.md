# COGS-181-SpikeDetection
A CNN trained on spike detection as a project for a class

This project was for COGS 181 at UCSD in the Winter of 2024.

This project consists of 3 files: A file to generate the templates for the recordings, a file to generate the recordings themselves, and a file containing the actual CNN and work for the project.
The recording file for this project is roughly 8 GB, so it will not be uploaded to this GitHub page, if people want to generate their own data this all comes from MEArec.
